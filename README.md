# Introduction: MasterProject

Land Markets Modeling and 3D Visualization

The code refers to the project I had to complete as a part of my Masters program in Geoinformation and Spatial Development.

- It is done to understand the Land Market Pattern Analysis in Cologne, Germany

- We used supervised ML methods, Multiple Regression Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks to analyse the data 

- The project is completed and understood that Social Infrastructure ( ß= 13.95) and Travel Time
( ß= -32.46)influence the Standard Land values to a higher extent. , followed by travel time to the subcentres, transportation frequency, Distance to the main road.7

- A novel attempt of using neural networks, made it possible to achieve better accuracy (MAPE = 62.93%) when compared to a Multiple Linear Regression Analysis (MAPE= 47.69%).
- There's still room for improvement and the locale, here Cologne, has it's individual characteristics of influence. We came to know it is the real estate sales transactions values.
- Future work would be involving the apartment sales which could provide a better understanding of the market.
- Land Valuation Experts could try to adopt the updated methods, which could give a better value and accurate prices.

## Data:

- Data for this project has been extracted from: https://www.boris.nrw.de/borisplus/?lang=de.
- We had to combine the data for the geocoded values to analyse it using a GIS software, ArcGIS.
- The excel sheet contains the cleaned version of data for each potential influence on the land market in Cologne.
